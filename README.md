## Usage
**[log.c](src/log.c?raw=1)** and **[log.h](src/log.h?raw=1)** should be dropped
into an existing project and compiled along with it. The library provides 6
function-like macros for logging:

```c
log_trace(const char *fmt, ...);
log_debug(const char *fmt, ...);
log_info(const char *fmt, ...);
log_warn(const char *fmt, ...);
log_error(const char *fmt, ...);
log_fatal(const char *fmt, ...);
```

Each function takes a printf format string followed by additional arguments:

```c
log_trace("Hello %s", "world")
```

Resulting in a line with the given format printed to stderr:

```
20:18:26 TRACE src/main.c:11: Hello world
```


#### log_set_quiet(bool enable)
Quiet-mode can be enabled by passing `true` to the `log_set_quiet()` function.
While this mode is enabled the library will not output anything to `stderr`, but
will continue to write to files and callbacks if any are set.


#### log_set_level(int level)
The current logging level can be set by using the `log_set_level()` function.
All logs below the given level will not be written to `stderr`. By default the
level is `LOG_TRACE`, such that nothing is ignored.


#### log_add_fp(FILE *fp, int level)
One or more file pointers where the log will be written can be provided to the
library by using the `log_add_fp()` function. The data written to the file
output is of the following format:

```
2047-03-11 20:18:26 TRACE src/main.c:11: Hello world
```

Any messages below the given `level` are ignored. If the library failed to add a
file pointer a value less-than-zero is returned.


#### log_add_callback(log_LogFn fn, void *udata, int level)
One or more callback functions which are called with the log data can be
provided to the library by using the `log_add_callback()` function. A callback
function is passed a `log_Event` structure containing the `line` number,
`filename`, `fmt` string, `va` printf va\_list, `level` and the given `udata`.


#### log_add_rolling_appender(rolling_appender ra, int level)
One or more rolling log appenders. This is functionally equivalent to
`log_add_fp()` from a logging standpoint. The function also handles log _file_
management based on the values provided by the `rolling_appender` struct
argument.

After a log entry pushes the log size over the `ra.max_log_size` value, your
active log is automatically rolled.

Rolled logs appear in the same directory as the active log, and retain the same
name as the active log, except a numeric value from `1` to `ra.max_logs`
is appended to the end of the file name.


#### log_set_lock(log_LockFn fn, void *udata)
If the log will be written to from multiple threads a lock function can be set.
The function is passed the boolean `true` if the lock should be acquired or
`false` if the lock should be released and the given `udata` value.


#### const char* log_level_string(int level)
Returns the name of the given log level as a string.


#### LOG_USE_COLOR
If the library is compiled with `-DLOG_USE_COLOR` ANSI color escape codes will
be used when printing.
